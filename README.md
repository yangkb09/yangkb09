# Nice to meet you, I'm Kat ðŸ‘‹

<img src="/public/cabbages.jpg" alt="Wall of cabbages in Shanghai, China" id="cabbages"/>

I'm a fullstack software engineer with a background in data science.

After graduating from the University of Maryland with a bachelor's in sociology, I began working at a nonprofit organization researching education inequity in the US.

During the pandemic, I began learning to code to diversify my skills and pursue my love for problem solving. I challenged myself to learn JavaScript through the Grace Hopper Program, a 17-week immersive fullstack program. I bring a background in social science to software engineering with a passion for making the world more equitable and accessible.
